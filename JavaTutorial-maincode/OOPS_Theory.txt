OOPS Benifits:
- Faster and easier execution
- Readability
- No dulicate codes / DRY (Dont repeat yourself)
- Resuse of code

Two main aspects of OOPS:
Class - class is a template for objects, or an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
Objects - an object is an instance of a class
